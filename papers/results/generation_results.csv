Strong SOC lifts the degeneracy at the Dirac point, opening a bulk bandgap.","The lattice distortion from the 1T phase to the 1T' phase induces band inversion, causing 1T'-WTe2 to become topologically non-trivial. Without spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the inverted bands cross at a momentum point along the 0 â€“ Y direction, forming a Dirac cone. Strong SOC lifts the degeneracy at the Dirac point, opening a bulk bandgap. In 1T-WTe2, the bands from 5dxz and 5dz2 orbitals of W are separated. Due to the symmetry breaking through the lattice distortion from 1T to 1T', these orbitals hybridize substantially. The dz2 orbital is lowered below EF whereas the dxz orbital lifts in the opposite direction near the 0 point. Because these two inverted bands have different parities at the 0 point, the Z2 invariant v, in which (-1)v is determined by the product of all occupied.",Explain what kind of control operations were used in the quantum supremacy circuits.,"The quantum supremacy circuits use control operations with single-qubit and two-qubit gates.
