Superconductivity is measured using a four-probe measurement scheme with voltage probes (Vxx, Vg), current (I), and bias voltage (Vbias). The electron density is tuned by a metal gate beneath the bottom hexagonal boron nitride layer.
In magic-angle TBG, superconductivity is achieved when the material is dopded slighlty away from the Mott insulator phase. 
The phase diagram, which depends on carrier density and temperature, shows two superconducting domes at low temperature separated by a Mott phase. Above the critical temperature, the superconducting phase becomes a metal.

A normal conductor can me modeled as a resistance with $R(B) = R_0(1+\mu^2 B^2)$ and a chiral conductor is represented as a resistance with a coil such that $R(I,B) = R_0(1+\mu^2 B^2 + \gamma B\cdot I)$.
The second harmonic response $V_{2\omega}$ shows a sudden sign reversal withing 0.5º when the current is applied along the c axis ($I||c$).

Strong SOC lifts the degeneracy at the Dirac point, opening a bulk bandgap in 1T'-WTe2 around the $\Gamma$ point.
ARPES is used to measure the band dispersion along high-symmetry paths such as $\Gamma - Y$ by measuring the photoemission spectrum.
The lattice distortion from the 1T phase to the 1T' phase induces band inversion, causing 1T'-WTe2 to become topologically non-trivial. Without spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the inverted bands cross at a momentum point along the 0 – Y direction, forming a Dirac cone. Strong SOC lifts the degeneracy at the Dirac point, opening a bulk bandgap. In 1T-WTe2, the bands from 5dxz and 5dz2 orbitals of W are separated. Due to the symmetry breaking through the lattice distortion from 1T to 1T', these orbitals hybridize substantially. The dz2 orbital is lowered below EF whereas the dxz orbital lifts in the opposite direction near the 0 point. Because these two inverted bands have different parities at the 0 point, the Z2 invariant v, in which (-1)v is determined by the product of all occupied.

Fe3GeTe2 has a hexagonal layered structure formed by slabs of Fe3Ge lying between layers of Te bound by weak van der Waals forces, with the symmetry of space group 194. The $a_1$ and $a_2$ vectors are 3.911 Angstroms long, and the $a_3$ vector is 16.33$
Wilson loops can be used to identify symmetry-protected topological nodal lines because their trace is quantized and experiences a $\pi$ jump when intersecting them. The value of the Wilson loop trace can be used to predict the presence of surface drumhead states.
The number of Weyl points at a chemical potential can be related to a change in absolute AHC, since the contribution of their Berry curvature is unloccked when filled. Their effect can be either to suppress or enhance the AHC.

They generate a plasma gas using a microwave-driven Electron-Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) source to ionize deuterium (D-D  source), or a mix of deuterium and tritium (D-T source). The ions generated in the plasma are accelerated towards a metallic target using a high-voltage  electric  field,  where  they  are  implanted  in  the  form  of  a  metal  hydride.  The remaining  ions  in  the  plasma  strike  the  previously  implanted  ones  in  the  target  leading  to fusion  events  that  release  monoenergetic  neutrons  of  14  or  2.5  MeV for  the  D-T  and  D-D sources, respectively.

Nodes and edges are both represented by feature vectors.
One example of a graph neural network architecture used to predict the physical properties of crystals is the Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (CGCNN). In this architecture, the distance between atoms is used to represent the edges in the crystal graph. The nodes represent atoms. The graph retains the information of the topological and geometric structure of crystals and records the periodicity and key crystal information, such as the crystal lattice vector and the cell volume.
The mean absolute error of the network predictions decreases with a higher volume of trianing data. The decrease is larger for lower volumes of data and less pronounced as training set size increases beyond 10000 samples.
