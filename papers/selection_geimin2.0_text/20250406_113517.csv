How are WTe2 samples usually characterized with ARPES?,"ARPES is used to characterize the electronic structure of $1T^0$-WTe2, and the signature of strong SOC in $1T^0$-WTe2 is the lifting of state degeneracy at the Dirac cones along the $\Gamma$-Y direction, resulting in the opening of a bulk gap.
The ARPES data shows faint tails of the bulk conduction band, so potassium is deposited onto the surface to raise $E_F$ and make the conduction band more clearly visible to ARPES.",ARPES is used to measure the band dispersion along high-symmetry paths such as $\Gamma - Y$ by measuring the photoemission spectrum.,,,
Explain the role of band inversions in the topological phase transition of WTe2.,"The lattice distortion from the 1T phase to the 1T' phase induces band inversion and causes 1T'-WTe2 to become topologically non-trivial.

Strong SOC lifts the degeneracy at the Dirac point, opening a bulk bandgap. In 1T-WTe2, the bands from $5d_{xz}$ and $5d_{z^2}$ orbitals of W are separated. Due to the symmetry breaking through the lattice distortion from 1T to 1T', these orbitals hybridize substantially. The $d_{z^2}$ orbital is lowered below $E_F$ whereas the $d_{xz}$ orbital lifts in the opposite direction near the $\Gamma$ point. Because these two inverted bands have different parities at the $\Gamma$ point, the $Z_2$ invariant $\nu$, in which (-1)$^{\nu}$ is determined by the product of all occupied Bloch states at the $\Gamma$ point.","The lattice distortion from the 1T phase to the 1T' phase induces band inversion, causing 1T'-WTe2 to become topologically non-trivial.

How are Wilson loops used to characterize the nodal lines in Fe3GeTe2?,Wilson loops are used to identify nodal crossings through their discontinuities and to predict the appearance of drum-head surface states in the projection of the nodal lines. The trace of the Wilson loop operator is used for this purpose. A π jump in the trace indicates a symmetry-protected nodal line. The value of the trace is related to the number of states with a positive mirror eigenvalue.,Wilson loops can be used to identify symmetry-protected topological nodal lines because their trace is quantized and experiences a $\pi$ jump when intersecting them.

Boron-graphdiyne (BGDY) is a member of the GDY family where single boron atoms replace the hexagonal carbon rings in the GDY lattice, forming a 2D honeycomb lattice with large hexagonal holes. It is a layered framework related to graphdiyne (GDY), formed by boron atoms connected by carbon chains containing diacetylenic  C≡C C≡C  linkages.","Graphdiyne (GDY) is a synthetic carbon allotrope with a layered framework formed by benzoic rings connected by carbon chains.

How can adsoprtion of transition metal atoms on BDGY be modeled?,"Adsorption of transition metal atoms on BGDY can be modeled using density functional theory calculations performed with the quantum-ESPRESSO suite of electronic structure codes, employing the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE) for the exchange-correlation functional. A repetitive cell containing 14 atoms (12 C and 2 B) and a vacuum spacing of 20 Å can be used to model the BGDY layer.",Adsorption of transition metal atoms on BGDY can be modeled using density functional theory.,,,
How are nodes and edges represented in a graph neural network?,"In a graph neural network:

*   Nodes usually represent atoms in a molecule.
*   Edges represent the chemical bonds between atoms.",Nodes and edges are both represented by feature vectors.,,,
Give me an example architecture of a graph neural network used to predict physical properties of crystals and describe the internal architecture.,"A geometric-information-enhanced crystal graph neural network (GeoCGNN) can be used to predict the properties of crystalline materials. It considers the distance vector between each node and its neighbors to learn full topological and spatial geometric structure information. The crystal graph retains the information of the topological and geometric structure of crystals and records the periodicity and key crystal information, such as the crystal lattice vector and the cell volume. The nodes represent atoms and edges represent the adjacency relationship among atoms. The node embeddings are updated using:

$v_0(z_i) = W(Onehot(z_i))$, $u_{ij} = r!_{i ¼ Embedding ij}$

where $v_0(z_i)$ is the initial node feature for atom $i$ with atomic number $z_i$, $W$ is a trainable weight matrix, $Onehot(z_i)$ is the one-hot encoding of the atomic number, and $u_{ij}$ is the edge feature between atoms $i$ and $j$. The lattice vectors $a, b, c$ and cell volume $\Omega$ are also recorded as crystal parameters.","One example of a graph neural network architecture used to predict the physical properties of crystals is the Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (CGCNN). In this architecture, the distance between atoms is used to represent the edges in the crystal graph. The nodes represent atoms.

How does the volume in training data affect graph neural networks?,"I am sorry, but the provided text does not contain information about how the volume of training data affects graph neural networks.",The mean absolute error of the network predictions decreases with a higher volume of trianing data. The decrease is larger for lower volumes of data and less pronounced as training set size increases beyond 10000 samples.,,,
